# redumper for macOS: upstream's own release build, repackaged. It ships its own
# libc++ in lib/ and finds it through RPATH @executable_path/../lib, so bin/ and
# lib/ stay together under libexec, and bin/redumper is a script that execs the
# real file (a symlink would hand the loader the wrong @executable_path).
#
# Homebrew allows no per-architecture url in a formula, only a per-architecture
# resource. So the url is the source tarball of the same tag -- it carries the
# LICENSE and README the binary zips lack, and Homebrew installs both -- and
# the binary comes from the resource for this machine.
#
# The build number follows fedora/redumper/redumper.spec: the same watcher bumps
# every lane in one commit.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Name the drive by its BSD name, as `diskutil list` shows it:
        redumper disc --drive=disk4
      (not /dev/disk4). No root is needed. macOS refuses drive access to a
      program working inside Desktop, Documents or Downloads, so dump into
      another folder.
